Modern dev means juggling multiple worktrees, Docker Compose stacks, detached containers, and background services — all competing for ports on localhost. `lsof -iTCP -sTCP:LISTEN` tells you a port is open; sonar tells you *what's behind it*: which container, which Compose project, how much memory it's eating, and gives you one command to kill it, tail its logs, or shell into it. No more piping `lsof` through `grep` and `awk` to figure out why port 3000 is already taken.

```
$ sonar list

## Features

- Docker-aware — resolves container names, images, compose services, and port mappings
- Colored output with clickable URLs
- Hides desktop apps (Figma, Discord, etc.) by default
- Configurable columns, filtering, and sorting
- JSON output for scripting
- Log streaming and process attach for Docker and native services
- Port forwarding, real-time watch mode, and more

## Install

```sh
curl -sfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raskrebs/sonar/main/install.sh | sh
```

This downloads the latest release binary and adds `~/.sonar/bin` to your PATH. Restart your terminal or run `source ~/.zshrc` to start using it.

To customize the install location:

```sh
curl -sfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raskrebs/sonar/main/install.sh | SONAR_INSTALL_DIR=/usr/local/bin sh
```

## Usage

### List ports

```sh
sonar list                     # show all ports
sonar list --filter docker     # only Docker ports
sonar list --sort name         # sort by process name
sonar list --json              # JSON output
sonar list -a                  # include desktop apps
sonar list -c port,compose,image,url  # custom columns
```

By default, sonar hides desktop apps and system services that happen to listen on TCP ports but aren't relevant to development. These include:

- **macOS `.app` bundles** — apps like Figma, Discord, Spotify, and Slack open local ports for IPC or update checks
- **macOS system services** — daemons under `/System/Library/` and `/usr/libexec/` (e.g. `rapportd`, `ControlCenter`, `AirPlay`)

Use `-a` / `--all` to include them.

Available columns: `port`, `process`, `pid`, `type`, `url`, `cpu`, `mem`, `threads`, `uptime`, `state`, `connections`, `container`, `image`, `containerport`, `compose`, `project`, `user`, `bind`, `ip`

### Inspect a port

```sh
sonar info 6873
```

Shows full details: command, user, bind address, Docker container/image/compose info.

### Open in browser

```sh
sonar open 3000
```

### Watch for changes

```sh
sonar watch              # poll every 2s
sonar watch -i 500ms     # poll every 500ms
```

Shows the initial table, then prints diffs as ports come and go.

### View logs

```sh
sonar logs 3000          # stream logs from a process
sonar logs 3000 -f=false # print recent logs without following
```

For Docker containers, streams `docker logs`. For native processes, discovers log files via `lsof` and tails them. Falls back to macOS `log stream` or Linux `/proc/<pid>/fd`.

### Attach to a service

```sh
sonar attach 6873              # interactive shell (Docker) or TCP connection
sonar attach 6873 --shell bash # use a specific shell for Docker exec
```

For Docker containers, opens an interactive shell inside the container. For other services, opens a raw TCP connection to the port.

### Port mapping

```sh
sonar map 6873 3002
```

Makes the service on port 6873 available on port 3002. Useful for accessing Docker services on a friendlier port.

### Kill a process

```sh
sonar kill 3000           # send SIGTERM
sonar kill 3000 -f        # send SIGKILL
```

Warns if the port belongs to a Docker container and suggests `docker stop` instead.

### Kill multiple processes

```sh
sonar kill-all --filter docker              # kill all Docker port processes
sonar kill-all --project my-app             # kill by Compose project
sonar kill-all --filter user -y             # skip confirmation
```

### Global flags

```sh
sonar --no-color           # disable colored output (also respects NO_COLOR env)
```

## Supported platforms

- macOS (uses `lsof`)
- Linux (uses `ss`)
